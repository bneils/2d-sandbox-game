# 2d-sandbox-game
This is a simple voxel-based sidescroller adventure game (clearly) mimicking games like Minecraft and Terraria.  I do not own any textures taken from the Faithful resource pack or from Mojang. The name of this project is subject to change whenever I feel like it.
# Build instructions
On Fedora, you need to install the packages `SDL2-devel` and `libuuid-devel` to compile.
